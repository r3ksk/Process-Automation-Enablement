RR1. As a First step, let us download JSON specification of the required APIs | ![](Images/DownloadJSONSpecification.png)
RR2. From the SAP Process Automation Create an Actions Project | ![](Images/CreateActionsProject.png)
RR3. Upload the JSON API Specification downloaded from SAP API Business hub | ![](Images/UploadJSONAPISpec.png)
RR4. In the next screen, select required APIs. it is the **POST** call for **A_BusinessPartner**. Click Add in the end | ![](Images/SelectRequiredAPI.png)
RR5. Once you add, you will get the detail view of the Added APIs | ![](Images/ActionsProjectAPIDetailView.png)
RR6. You may choose to keep only specific input/output fields to the workflow need. In this way you control minimum data added to your workflow context. | ![](Images/IncludeCSRFToken.png)
RR7. Release and deploy the actions project. |
RR9.Let us create a brand new Business Process Project called **<Your Name>_Business Partner Creation Project** | ![](Images/CreateBusinessProcessProject.png)
RR10. Add a new Business Process.  | ![](Images/AddABusinessProcess.png)
RR11. Give a name to your Business Process. You can give a name like **Business Partner Approval Process** | ![](Images/NameBusinessProcess.png)
RR12. Add a request form to this business process | ![](Images/CreateRequestForm.png)
RR13. Give a name to the newly added form. You may like to name it as **Business Partner Request Form** | ![](Images/NameRequestForm.png)
RR14. Open the newly created Request Form | ![](Images/OpenRequestForm.png)
RR15. Add the required fields. here is a suggestion | ![](Images/DesignRequestForm.png)
RR16. Create a Data Type called **Business Partner** | ![](Images/CreateDataType.png)
RR17. Add Required Fields to **Business Partner** datatype. Don't forget few options for listbox item. Here I used **1,2,3** | ![](Images/DataTypeFields.png)
RR18. Add a condition to the flow | ![](Images/AddCondition.png)
RR19. Open the Condition Editor | ![](Images/OpenConditionEditor.png)
RR20. Here is a sample condition you may use, for ex, you can check if **category not equal to 1** & **organization not equal to your company name** | ![](Images/ConditionEditorValues.png)
RR21. Add a new decision to the approval flow. | ![](Images/AddANewDecision.png)
RR22. Name your Decision as **Search Term Decision**. Open the newly created decision | ![](Images/NameDecision1.png)
RR22. Design Decision input **Business Partner** and output as **Business Partner** | ![](Images/DesignDecision1InputOutput.png)
RR23. Add a new Rule to this decision | ![](Images/AddANewRule1.png)
RR24. Name the rule  as **SearchTermRule**. It will be a text rule | ![](Images/DetermineFilter.png)
RR25. Add the necessary output parameter under the configuration tab | ![](Images/DecisionConfiguration1.png)
RR26. A sample rule can be if search term is empty, you can return the given organization name. You can design your rule according to your needs. | ![](Images/RuleDesign1.png)
RR27. Switch to the business Process and configure decision input | ![](Images/ConfigureDecisionInput1.png)
RR28. We will create an approval form  | ![](Images/CreateNewApprovalForm.png)
RR29. This new approval form will be based on the existing request form | ![](Images/NameApprovalForm.png)
RR30. As this task will be assigned to requester's manager, we will configure General tab with proper input | ![](Images/ProcessGeneralTab.png)
RR31. Now we will map every field from the request form with the corresponding field in approval form | ![](Images/ApprovalFormMapping.png)
RR32. Open the Approval form, ensure all fields from request form are readonly and add a manager's comments field. | ![](Images/EditApprovalForm.png)
RR33. You may also send an email to the requester as part of the approval flow. | ![](Images/AddEmail.png)
RR34. SAP Process Automation Process Builder provides a email composer | ![](Images/MailEditor.png)
RR35. Feel free to write your version of the email. For this tutorial purpose, this is a sample content. | ![](Images/MailBody.png)
RR34. One final step is remaining. Switch to the business process, for the rejection workflow add an end for now. or you can add a notification form | ![](Images/FinalStep.png)
RR36. Now it is time to make the **Business Partner** POST API call to determine create the approved Business Partner in the system | ![](Images/IncludePerEmpJobAction.png)
RR37. As a first step, refer to the preconfigured destination for this actions project. Destination through an environment variable. We needed to add an environment variable | ![](Images/SelectDestination.png)
RR38. Name the destination variable | ![](Images/NameDestinationVariable.png)
RR39. In the end, after adding destination it will look like this | ![](Images/AfterAddingDestinations.png)
RR40. We will configure filter parameter based on the decision output. This will be equivalent to such an API call in postman '{{baseUrl}}/EmpJob?&$filter=userId eq '<userid> | ![](Images/ActionFilter1.png)
RR34. You can release and deploy the business process. In the deployed process, find the url from the request form to test | ![](Images/TestTheBusinessProcess.png)
